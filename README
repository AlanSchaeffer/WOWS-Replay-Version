This Ruby script will extract the World of Warships client version from replay 
files and place it at the end of the filename, just before the extension, 
for example:
20160805_230505_PRSD109-Pr-48-Kiev_22_tierra_del_fuego.wowsreplay
becomes ->
20160805_230505_PRSD109-Pr-48-Kiev_22_tierra_del_fuego 0.5.9.wowsreplay

How to use:
If you do not have Ruby on your computer install it from 
https://www.ruby-lang.org

Place the script add_versions.rb on the same folder as the replays you want
to get labeled, and then double click the script. It will rename all the
replays on the same folder.
